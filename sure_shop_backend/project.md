Use PostgreSQL in managed environment

Performance Considerations:

Connection Pooling (HikariCP)

Asynchronous email & invoice handling

Caching (if needed): for product views

Pagination in all GET endpoints

✅ Final Deliverables Summary
✅ API	RESTful, well-structured, JWT-secured
✅ Swagger	Live documentation with try-out buttons
✅ Stripe Integration	Simulated real-world checkout flow
✅ Role Separation	Customer/Admin-specific access
✅ Email Service	Auto confirmation emails
✅ PDF Invoices	On order confirmation
✅ Analytics API	Admin insights
✅ Dockerized App	Easy deployment & scaling
✅ Postman Collection	For quick testing
✅ Clean GitHub Repo	README, Setup, Usage Guide

📈 Scalability for 300 Users
To ensure the app can handle 300 concurrent users:

Use connection pooling (e.g., HikariCP) to manage DB connections efficiently

Configure application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=50
server.tomcat.max-threads=200
server.tomcat.accept-count=100
Deploy with a dedicated PostgreSQL instance (managed DBs like Supabase, NeonDB)

Use caching (e.g., Spring Cache + Redis for hot data like products)

Asynchronous processes (like email, invoice generation) with @Async

Proper indexing in PostgreSQL (on user_id, order_id, etc.)
